A simple language with dependent types written in Pseudo-Python (<=> implementations in Python, Ruby, Go, C#, JS)

Act as a real world example to Pseudo's development forward in a similar way to Servo and Rust

The language:

	A very simple ruby-like language, the minimal set of features needed to demonstrate dependent types

The plan:

    * A parser
        Either manually or write a little parser-combinators library for Pseudo

    * A type checker

    * A very simple interpreter

    * Improve Pseudo all the time
